33Grn,Considerable Improvement,Moderate Improvement,Very Unlikely,Very Unlikely,Yes,Very Easy,Very Satisfied,The simplicity and easy user interface. You just click it once and it gives you an answer. ,"Only adding a new website, but even that wasn't particularly challenging","No, I like the simplicity of it. ","Keep it as simple as possible, that's how you'll keep people using it. "
Bat67,Slight Improvement,Moderate Improvement,Likely,Very Unlikely,Probably Not,Easy,Satisfied,The blocker warning is useful. It is nice that you can save a list of sites as well. ,Understanding how exactly setting sites as protected was a bit confusing. ,"I think having a common database, well im not sure if there is one, but listing that would be helpful. ",no.
Hen23,Considerable Improvement,Moderate Improvement,Unlikely,Very Unlikely,Probably Yes,Very Easy,Satisfied,I think its useful that it tells you when something has been changed about a website. I find it very helpful you can also add the websites you want to be protected.,I was initially confused on how the extension would work during the simulation because I did not know that it had already added the bank to the protected website. I was also confused on how to add a website to the MobyPhish extension.  ,"It would be nice if the MobyPhish extension said from what issuer the website changed from to the new issuer. I'm not sure if I am remembering correctly either, but it would also be nice if the MobyPhish extension pointed out the error in the url spelling if it was wrong. Also, it would be nice to have MobyPhish automated, rather than having to go and click on the fish each time on the protected website.","It would be nice if MobyPhish worked for emails as well, as there are some phishing emails getting sent to UConn students."
Pnk16,Considerable Improvement,Slight Improvement,Unlikely,Very Unlikely,Probably Yes,Easy,Neutral,I found it most useful how easy it was to report a site. It was also useful when I would get a flashing/pop up message saying that something had changed on the website and to be cautious.,"I am still a bit confused on how to use the extension, such as do I have to click on the extension every time I think a website is suspicious, or will it notify me without clicking?","I wish the extension had more pop-up or banner messages to display a possible phishing scam, or a way to investigate if the website is a scam or not.","No

43Cub,Considerable Improvement,Considerable Improvement,Unlikely,Unlikely,Yes,Very Easy,Very Satisfied,The quick reaction it had and how it makes sure you are alert,How to install it and to add websites to the list,automatic closing of the fraudulent websites,I really like it and it would be very helpful in real life circumstances
Cat90,Considerable Improvement,Moderate Improvement,Very Unlikely,Very Unlikely,Maybe,Easy,Neutral,I appreciated that it constantly reminded me when I needed to research the website to decide if it was safe or not. I appreciated that I could just click the fish icon and it would verify that the website I was using was safe.,"I found the warnings relatively useful but the constant clicking and checking the certificate and the fish is surprisingly time consuming. Some malware extensions detect it automatically. It seems to alert me if that I'm going to be entering personal info, and reminds me that I should probably should probably check if the website is secure instead of analyzing whether or not the website is secure for me. Especially with the URLs, people can easily fall victim to a simple missed letter.",I wish that I did not have to constantly check and be proactive (inertia am I right?) in my own security. I think it is very functional but it misses the fact that people would rather be lazy and do nothing unless blocked from the website due to the extension blocking it because it knows there is malware.,Just remember that people have inertia.
80Bee,Slight Improvement,Moderate Improvement,Neutral,Unlikely,Probably Yes,Easy,Satisfied,The report button was useful to immediately report any phishing websites.,None - the extension was fairly simple to use.,None,No
Yel16,Moderate Improvement,Considerable Improvement,Unlikely,Very Unlikely,Maybe,Easy,Satisfied,"It was most useful that the extension checked the SSL link for me.

56Lime,Moderate Improvement,Moderate Improvement,Neutral,Unlikely,Yes,Very Easy,Satisfied,The Minimalistic feature of Categorizing the Website Safety was very much useful without spending much of time on checking the Information.,I have not found any aspect to be confusing,Grouping of Websites as Category lists could be one feature to enhance User navigation within the extension and an easy search option,Nothing
84Tan,Considerable Improvement,Significant Improvement,Likely,Unlikely,Yes,Very Easy,Satisfied,"I liked how accessible the whole extension was, especially the fact it only took one click rather than three to see if it was a phishing site.

39Mag,Considerable Improvement,Significant Improvement,Neutral,Likely,Yes,Easy,Very Satisfied,"I enjoyed that it simply tells you if the site you are on is safe or not. Ive used other extensions like this and they don't make it clear. This dumbed it down for me, in a good way. ","It glitched out a couple times - there would be a flash warning sign and then it would go away and just say ""Protected site."" That made it hard to tell whether or not the site actually was safe.","It was relatively confusing to know how and what to put in the list of website for the extension. Id like it if it could offer some websites I often use, and then choose from those, which ones Id like it to remember. ","Its a good site, but it just comes off a little unorganized. The videos were a bit disorganized, the placement of buttons and the instructions were a little disorganized. I think just cleaning it up visually will help. "

28Cow,Considerable Improvement,Moderate Improvement,Very Unlikely,Very Unlikely,Probably Yes,Very Easy,Satisfied,How it would tell me if there was something wrong with the link,One challenging part what to do after the extension showed up. What steps to do after it shows up.,No,No

90Lime,Considerable Improvement,Considerable Improvement,Likely,Neutral,Yes,Very Easy,Very Satisfied,"I like how easily it is built into the browser.

Bee7,Significant Improvement,Significant Improvement,Unlikely,Unlikely,Yes,Very Easy,Satisfied,"Even when the extension is just running in the background, it is able to detect and alert the user of a possible attack.

17Grn,Considerable Improvement,Significant Improvement,Very Unlikely,Very Unlikely,Yes,Very Easy,Very Satisfied,"Being able to just click one icon and have it check made it the most useful. It was extremely simple, so I did not have to worry about my lack of computer science or cybersecurity getting in the way of protecting my information.

30Tan,Slight Improvement,Slight Improvement,Unlikely,Very Unlikely,Maybe,Easy,Neutral,I found that its simplicity was most useful.,Nothing seemed to complicated or difficult,Not any specific functionalities come to mind.,The warning was very sudden and made it seem as though it was an intrusive pop-up and took me a little bit to realize it was the warning from the Mobyphish extension
49Fox,Considerable Improvement,Slight Improvement,Very Likely,Likely,Maybe,Difficult,Neutral,"I didn't really use the extension, in fact from what I can understand, had me try to save my password for a website that was a phishing website, which was confusing.","I didn't really use the phishing website, after I wasn't able to use it in the five or so rounds I gave up trying to use it as and just checked the url and SSL to determine if the site was legit.","I saved the proper site in the beginning, but it never sent me any sort of alerts or anything when I was on a phishing site.

When the website is different, it's really obvious but I'm more unlikely to check the certification and that really helps!",Nothing so far!,Any sort of virus scanning as well. To check if the attachments or such on the site will cause viruses on your computer.,Not at the moment.

88Tan,Considerable Improvement,Considerable Improvement,Likely,Neutral,Yes,Easy,Satisfied,"While I hopefully will always keep an eye out for myself when it comes to possible phishing attacks and scams, it's very helpful to have an asset that I can trust to know that it's watching over everything I do and could tell me, OK, this is a legitimate site with a legitimate certificate, without me necessarily having to check over that every time.","I would hope that, in practice, a real MobyPhish extension would automatically alert me to possible issues as soon as I land on a sketchy page, instead of me having to manually click on the extension icon to check if everything is OK.","I don't know if it's actually possible, but maybe there's a way to instantly confirm the site certificate with one click of the MobyPhish extension icon, rather than having to click three separate things to get that site certificate the standard way.","It's a promising idea and I wish you well. I hope to see something like this made more available to people who aren't specifically into tech issues and wouldn't naturally gravitate to a study like this, and I hope that this Chrome experiment is a starting point that would then be available on additional platforms."

50Fox,Moderate Improvement,Slight Improvement,Likely,Likely,Probably Yes,Very Difficult,Very Dissatisfied,"I had a hard time understanding not only the purpose, but how to use the extension. I appreciate that it acts like a log, checking if the website you're using is accurate to the one you've previously logged with mobyphish. Yet the physical use is very confusing, when I click on the fish icon, am i checking or logging? ","As explained last time, I just dont really have a great grasp on the whole thing. I only reported 1 website because there was an obvious reason it was a scam. Was the pop up part of the moby phish extension? I think if you're creating a product aimed at people with low levels of media literacy, the product need to be more accessible. ","Along with a deeper grasp on what it is and how im supposed to use it, i need more colored icons and more clear indicators.",I like the little fish icon! He is cute.
